# Panelized Pagoda 2 antennas

I used the panelizer from gerber tools to manually panelize the PCBs. This repo contains 2 gerber files. The first is the Pagoda 2 with 3 RHCP and 3 LHCP. The second is The Pagoda 2B with 3 RHCP and 3 LHCP. I have uploaded this to JLCPCB and it looks to be good. I have not ordered any yet, but plan to in the future.
